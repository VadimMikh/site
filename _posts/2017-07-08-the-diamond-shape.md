On this blog post we are going to look at the way that Programming departments are, or can be, organised. We will look at it from the view point of seniority/experience of the team. We will look at how other companies are organized, and how we try to organise ourselves at Codurance.

The structures we are going to looking at are:

    - [The Pyramid](#pyramid)
    - [The Flat Structure](#flat-structure)
    - [The Other Flat Structure](#other-flat)
    - [The Diamond Shape](#diamond)

## <a name="pyramid"></a>The Pyramid - The traditional shape

ToDo:

Traditionally, most companies have a pyramidal shape across the whole company in the distribution of their seniority.

At the top you will have a combination of CTO, CIO, Development Director.

Then you will move into your Development Manager(s).

If you have architects could be a separate structure, or embedded as part of the bigger structure.

You will have more principals (Tech Leads/ Team Leads) than on the previous level. A few (or a lot) more seniors than on the previous level, a few more mid level developers, and finally the biggest number of employees are Juniors.

### Growing

I have found that companies grow on two ways the pyramid. The first one, is adding at the bottom. There are two possibilities here: either the base of the pyramid grows disproportinately compared to the other levels, or you start promoting personnel, keeping the overall shape of the pyramid stable. The second one is 

### Issues

There are a couple of major issues with this structure. 

    - The first is that more than half (using the finger-in-the-air algorithm) of your workforce is not going to be able to create software of enough quality such that project will be easy to maintain, extend and scale.
    - The second is that juniors will not receive the necessary mentoring from their more experienced colleagues to quickly improve their skills. Or to be even helped in creating a good solution.

ToDo: Add Image of Flat Structure

Another possible structure is a pure flat one, only comprised of senior people. Under this structure you don't hire junior developers. Only senior people are added to the team. It avoids the first issue on [The Pyramid](#pyramid) altogether There are some consultancies where this is done. They 

### Growing

### Issues

With no internal way of developing personnel you have to rely completely on other companies to provide that training. Which could be problematic if your company does niche work, or if it becomes difficult to find programmers that are in a similar wavelength.

## <a name="other-flat"></a>The Other Flat Structure

There is another version of the flat structure, because I've seen it happening. This one you have maybe one or two really senior people and then a non-ending carousel of juniors.

### Growing

### Issues

This is probably the worst possible structure. You get no guidance, no improvement of skills (juniors will leave a the first opportunity), and bad code that becomes difficult to change and no one understands.

ToDo: Add image Diamond Shape

The diamond shape is what we try to follow at Codurance. What you can see here is that we restrict the number of juniors (apprentices) in the organisation, based on the amount of more senior people. We are truncating the pyramid.



The goals are two-fold, both of them hitting at the issues show on the pyramid hieraerchy:

    a) We invert the ratio number between junior and seniors, so junior people get to receive better help/training/mentoring from not just one but multiple seniors
    b) We are in a condition to always provide mostly senior developers to our clients
    
### Growing

Like with the pyramid, you need to decide at what level you will be growing, if you are keeping the ratio of the shape, or modify that ratio.
